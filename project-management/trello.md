# Trello

Trello is a collaboration tool. It allows you to manage projects on boards, with tasks as `cards` (which are basically virtual sticky notes).

Because of the versatility of the tool, it can be used in diffferent ways for different projects. The Classic way is having a `to-do`, `doing`, and `done` lists.
