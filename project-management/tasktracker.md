# Task Tracker

The task tracker was used after sticky notes but before Trello. The main reason is was used was because it allowed for more flexibility

## Example

This is an example of how we do task tracker, this version specifically is on Excel. A task tracker like this is nice because everything is on one spreadsheet, so it is easy to update which tasks are done and which tasks now are ready to start. The main disadvantage is that when we tried it in 2016-17 no one actually looked at the it.
