# Project Management

Project Management is based around keeping track of tasks for the team

## Systems

Many systems have been used throughout the years (after the disaster of sticky notes). While we are currently using Trello and there is some documentation based on that, there will also be documentation on previous systems we have used.

These are the various systems we have used:

- [Task Tracker](tasktracker)
- [Trello](trello)
